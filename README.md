# Clients_segmentation

Starting from the Online Retail dataset of UCI Machine Learning, we perform a segmentation of customers with various types of algorithms and data processing. 

In Clustering_transform we make an analysis of the different types of data treatments and look for the optimal number of clusters for various models, relying on a dendrogram, the elbow method and silhouette score.

In Clustering_standard we perform the same analysis but using only normalized data.
